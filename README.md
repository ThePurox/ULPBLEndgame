# This is amodified version of THE ENDGAME keyboard to make it wireless
 This works by using a SuperMini NRF52840 or a nice!nano. Sadly, there's not solution with castellated holes so the soldering is a little bit... special. Here are some pictures of the board:

## CASE

There's an updated version of the case with a slot for a battery, please measure which battery will fit as it is a pretty small opening. ZMK is pretty power efficient os that's not an issue.

## FIRMWARE

Included is a precompiled firmware ZMK Studio ready as well as the source I've used.


## MY BUILD

<img src="https://github.com/quark-works/TheEndgame2024-BLE/blob/main/004%20IMAGES/BLE-BUILD.jpeg" alt="BUILD">

## Caveats:
- Soldering is a little on the harder side. You gotta align the board and feed enough solder so it melts and attaches both the pads on the PCB and the pads on the micro.
- I don't fully like how close the battery pads are. Be careful when you solder the batter. My recommendarion is: Solder one pad, add tape, then solder the other pad.
- I'd love to remake this board to have everything preassembled but this version works well enough. If there's enough interest I might just do it.

## Who the F... is Alice ##


Inspired by the legendary TGR Alice, the ENDGAME pays homage to a true classic. While it might not claim the top spot for ergonomics, it's design speaks for itself an iconic piece you’ll want to show off, even if it takes a bit of time for your fingers to adjust.

This low profile keyboard is built for high performance typing. Its slightly staggered layout works beautifully for both ergonomic beginners and experienced users. The unique bottomless top mount design makes it incredibly slim, lightweight, and perfect for those on the move.



## Everything You Need, All In One Place ##

Get the entire kit from KeebSupply, a trusted vendor with affordable international shipping. It’s your one stop shop for everything you need highly recommended! [Buy here](https://keeb.supply/products/endgame)

For an excellent build guide, check out this fantastic resource from KeebSupply. I haven’t had the time to create my own guide (and honestly, I couldn’t top this one). Big thanks to @KeebSupply! [Build Guide and Supplies](https://docs.keeb.supply/endgame/)



## PARTS LIST PCB ##

- 1x The Endgame PCB             [Gerber Files](https://github.com/OldMan6955/TheEndgame2024/tree/main/001%20PCB)

There are now two versions of the PCB:
1.	COPPER Version:
In this version, all design elements are on the copper and mask layers. I used this version to create my prototypes. However, this version has longer loading times, and the Gerber files currently don’t work with JLCPCB. (I’d greatly appreciate any help with troubleshooting this issue.)
2.	SILKSCREEN Version:
This version is untested. All design elements have been moved to the silkscreen layer, making it much more performant on less powerful PCs. The Gerber files display correctly on JLCPCB but have not yet been tested.
Please always test the files yourself to rule out potential errors. Thank you!

## PARTS LIST FDM CASE ##

- 4x M3 6mm countersunk          [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001199728978.html)
- 4x M3 5mm flathead             [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005069968742.html)

You can choose either countersunk or flathead screws both work well. Countersunk screws automatically align the PCB, while flathead screws allow you to manually align and adjust as needed.
The hole for the heat inserts is 4mm deep, and the PCB is 1.6mm thick, so 5mm screws are a perfect fit. Just double-check how the screw length is measured, as this can vary.

- 12x M3 D6.6mm grommet black     [buy here](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4000712868621.html)

You’ll need 4 grommets if you’re aiming for a bit of flex or bounce, but you can use up to 12 depending on your preference. They work perfectly as feet and provide excellent grip on my desk. Alternatively, bumpons are a great option too.

## SWITCHES AND KEYCAPS ##

Switches

I highly recommend the Choc v1 Silent switches, such as [Nocturnal](https://keeb.supply/products/nocturnal-low-profile-switches) or [Twilights](https://keeb.supply/products/twilight-low-profile-switches). If you prefer heavier springs and a bit of tactile feedback but don’t need silence, [Sunset](https://keeb.supply/products/sunset-low-profile-switches) switches are an excellent choice. As for the rest of the Choc v1 lineup, I wouldn’t bother—they’re not worth considering.

Keycaps

My go-to choice is standard [MBK](https://keeb.supply/products/mbk-keycaps) keycaps, but personal preference always plays a role. For your setup, you’ll need:

- 30x 1U keycaps for the alpha keys (or 28x 1U and 2x 1U homing keycaps)
- 4x 1.5U and 2x 1U convex keycaps for the bottom row

Check with your local vendor, they’re in stock almost everywhere these days. A great way to test switches and keycaps is by attending meetups, there might be an active community near you.
